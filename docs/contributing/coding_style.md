# Coding Style

- Main guidelines are:
    - Use python type hinting in every function and class, including return types
    - Always use docstrings for Classes and Functions/Methods
    - Always prefer double-quotes rather than single quotes
    - Adhere as close as possible to google style docstrings, auto-generated documentation is dependent on it and a merge request will not make it into `dev` if they are missing
    - Always indent with 4 spaces, no more, no less
    - Naming of classes should always be CamelCase and functions should be snake_case
    - Never raise exceptions from the base Exception, write custom ones if required
- Minimum version of Python to use during development and testing must be `3.10.12`
- Always use [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) when possible as they are far more superior than `%` and `.format()` in most cases
- Always write tests for any new functions/API calls implemented or changed (if the logic has changed)
- All functions should follow the typical API documentation format, more on this can be found here `to-do`
- List comprehensions should always be used where possible unless the code is too ugly and readable, that is for you and the reviewer to agree with :-)
